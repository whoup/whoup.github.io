        Who Up ("Who Up?" or "we" or "us" or "our" or other similar pronouns) takes your privacy matters very seriously. Please read the following to learn more about our Privacy Policy ("Policy"). This Policy details how we receive, collect and use information in connection with our Who Up software ("Who Up? App") service.
        <br><br>
        By using the Service, you are accepting the policies and practices described in this Policy, as such Policy may be amended from time to time. Each time you use the Service, you agree and expressly consent to our collection, use and disclosure of the information that you provide as described in this Policy.
        <br><br>
        To be clear about the terminology we are using, when we use the phrase "Personal Information" in this Policy, we mean information about you that is personally identifiable, like your name, address, e-mail address, as well as other non-public information that is associated with this personal information. When we use the phrase "Anonymous Information" in this Policy, we mean information that is not personally identifiable, or linked to your Personal Information such as aggregated information, general demographic information and IP addresses. Anonymous Information does not necessarily enable identification of individual persons.
        <br><br>
        IF YOU ARE A USER ACCESSING THE SITE OR SERVICE FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION, ASIA, OR ANY OTHER REGION WITH LAWS OR REGULATIONS GOVERNING PERSONAL DATA COLLECTION, USE, AND DISCLOSURE THAT DIFFER FROM UNITED STATES LAWS, PLEASE BE ADVISED THAT THROUGH YOUR CONTINUED USE OF THE SITE AND SERVICE, WHICH ARE GOVERNED BY UNITED STATES LAW, THIS PRIVACY POLICY, AND OUR END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT, YOU MAY BE TRANSMITTING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION TO COUNTRIES (INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES) WHERE LAWS REGARDING PROCESSING PERSONAL INFORMATION MAY BE LESS STRINGENT THAN THE PROCESSING OF PERSONAL INFORMATION IN YOUR COUNTRY AND YOU HEREBY CONSENT TO SUCH TRANSMISSION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION.

          <h3>Collection and Use of Information</h3>
            <h5>Who Up App</h5>
            <p>
            When you install the Who Up App you will be asked to provide us with your email, handle and a password (passwords cannot be seen by us whatsoever).
            <br><br>
            The copy of your address book (user handles) is stored on a live database. This database does not have a "historical backup". If you delete the contacts from our servers (more about this below), it will be deleted instantly and permanently.
            </p>
            <h5>User Handles</h5>
            <p>User handles will only be seen by other users, your email address can only be seen by yourself.
            </p>
            <h5>Online Status and Seen Status</h5>
            <p>Other users will see your connection status (whether you are online or not – and if not, when was the last time you were connected to the service, i.e. you were up) as well as whether you saw messages they sent to you.
            </p>
            <h5>Location Information</h5>
            <p>Who Up currently does not collect any location information about any of its users.</p>
            <h5>Third-Party Sites and Privacy Practices</h5>
            <p>You may arrive at our Site and/or download the Who Up App from another website. In addition, our Site may contain links that will let you leave our Site and access another website. Websites linked to or from our Site are not under the control of Who Up and it is possible that these websites have a different privacy policy. Our Policy applies solely to Personal Information that is acquired on the Site or through your use of our Service, and/or your relationship with Who Up. We urge you to be careful when you enter any Personal Information online. We accept no responsibility or liability for these other websites.</p>
            <h5>Analytics Collection</h5>
            <p>
            Who Up uses Google Analytics to help us anonymously track and report user/visitor behavior information and users' standard log information to the App and Site. This information (including but not limited to: IP address, data storage, maintenance services, database management, web analytics and information processing) helps us analyze and evaluate how the App and Site are used as part of our ongoing efforts to improve the Site and App's features and services. No personally identifying data is included in this type of reporting. Google Analytics may have access to your information only for the purposes of performing these tasks and on behalf of Who Up and under obligation similar in those in this Privacy Policy. For more information about the terms that govern Google Analytics, please visit the Google Analytics terms of service. 
            <br><br>
            We will never (and will not allow any third party to) use the statistical analytics tool to track or to collect any Personal Information of visitors or users. Google will not associate your IP address with any other data held by Google. Neither we nor Google will link, or seek to link, an IP address with the identity of a device user. We will not associate any data gathered from this site with any Personally Identifiable Information from any source, unless you explicitly submit that information via a fill-in form on our website.

          <h3>Sharing and Disclosure of Information</h3>
            <p>
              We do not rent, sell, or share any information about our users with any third-parties, except as specifically described herein. We may disclose your Personal Information if we believe such action is necessary to:
            <br><br>

          <h3>Children's Privacy</h3>
          <p>
            Who Up websites and software clients are not intended for or designed to attract anyone under the age of 13 and we do not intentionally or knowingly collect Personal Information on our sites from anyone under the age of 13 (or older in some jurisdictions). We encourage parents to be involved in the online activities of their children to ensure that no information is collected from a child without parental permission.

        <li>
          <h3>Security</h3>
          <p>We take reasonable precaution to protect Personal Information from misuse, loss and unauthorized access. Although we cannot guarantee that Personal Information will not be subject to unauthorized access, we have physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards in place to protect Personal Information. Personal Information is stored on our servers and protected by secured networks to which access is limited to a few authorized employees and personnel. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure.

          <h3>Business Transitions</h3>
          <p>
            In the event that we go through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, Personal Information will likely be among the assets transferred. As part of such a transaction the new entity will be required to commit to the same level of protection of your Personal Information as described in this Privacy Policy. If we cannot obtain such a commitment, we will not perform the business transition.
            <br><br>
            We will post a notice on this Site of any such change in ownership or control of the Personal Information we may have prior to such transfer.

          <h3>Changes to Policy</h3>
          <p>
            From time to time, we may revise this Policy. We reserve the right to update or modify this Policy, or any other of our policies or practices, at any time with or without notice. However, we will not use your Personal Information in a way that is materially different than the uses described in this Policy without giving you an opportunity to opt-out of such differing uses. We will post the revised Policy on the Site, so that users can always be aware of what information we collect, how the information is used and under what circumstances such information may be disclosed. You agree to review the Policy periodically so that you are aware of any modifications. Your continued use of the Site indicates your assent to any changes and signifies your agreement to the terms of our Policy. If you do not agree with these terms, you should not use the Site, the Who Up App, or any other Service.

            Due to technological reasons, we do not know when and if you delete the application. Since since we are not certain that you deleted the application (you may just be on vacation, etc.) we will not deactivate your Who Up account. We do not want to force you to register again in the event of non-use.
